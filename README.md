# Scottish Prison Population Statistics: data wrangling and visualisation

## Purpose

This repository contains the data and syntax required to wrangle data and produce charts from the Scottish Prison Population Statistics 2023-24 publication.

These charts contextualise information about people experiencing imprisonment in Scotland, and compare this cohort to the cohort of individuals who have died a drug-related death. All data used is open-source and was collected from the [Scottish Government](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-prison-population-statistics-2023-24/documents/) and [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland-in-2023/) websites.


## How to run this code

The syntax in this repository was written in the R programming language.

It is recommended that you run the code chunk-by-chunk in an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) such as [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), in order to read the comments in-line and view the outputs in real time.
